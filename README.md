## My process

### Built with

- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to handle a complex set of interactible buttons and create a 3-way switch

### Continued development

I need to learn how to better organize and implement my code. I feel like my code could have been better organized and more efficient.

### Useful resources

- [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tutorial-build-calculator-app/) - This helped me understand all the functionality that goes into a calculator. Reading through their code and really making sense of it was a huge help.
